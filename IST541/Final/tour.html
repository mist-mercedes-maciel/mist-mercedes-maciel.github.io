		<div class="stepDescription">
			<br>
			<p>Once the tour has started, keep an eye on your watch and adjust your tour accordingly. To do this, you must be prepare to leave out or abbreviate some of the information, stories or interpretation of some buildings and stop spots. For example, leave out or abbrevaite the bridge story, the oil house, barn, and/or carpenter shop. </p>
			<p>Visitors like to see inside building, even if you don't have much to say about them, so an alternative time saver is to let them go inside buildings like the Fog Signal room and the Keeper's house but don't interpret the site.</p>

		 <h3>Last Stop, the VC</h3>

		<div class="stepDescription">
			<br>
			<p>The Visitors Center is the last stop of a tour, and it is very important to reach this spot on time (around two hours from the scheduled start of the tour). This will give visitors ample time to watch the videos, look around at the merchandise available for purchase, and to pay the tour entrance fee before you and D2 start escorting visitors to the parking area. </p>
			<br>
			<p>Around 30 minutes before the tour ends, gather visitors outside the VC for some farewell information.</p>
			<ul>
			<li>Thank them for their visit!</li>
			<li>Inform them about the CCLK organization and the restoration efforts.</li>	
			<li>Inform them about our volunteering and donations opportunities. </li>
			<li>Make sure you have the end of tour safety talk</li>	
			</ul>
<br>			
			<p><strong>Safety talk</strong></p>
				<ol>
					<li>Do not run down the road.</li>
					<li>Stay as a group.</li>
					<li>Let docent car out of the parking area first.</li>
					<li>Pull onto Highway 1 slwoly (loose gravel).</li>

		 <h3>Some things to Consider..</h3>
		</summary>
	<div class="stepContent">
		<div class="stepDescription">
			<br>
			<ul>
			<li>The Barn and the Carpenter shop are example of our restoration efforts and this information help with fundraising.</li>
			<li>If there are two groups on your tour, coordinate with D2 about which buildings you will be accessing. This way, one group won't be wondering why the other group got to go somewhere they did not.</li>	
			<li>Also, tour groups should be no more than five minutes apart. A group that gets to the VC quickly feels like it is being held hostage until the other group gets there to finish the tour.</li>
