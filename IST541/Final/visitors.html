			  <li>Visitors must <strong>stay on the pavement</strong> and watch their step while walking up the road.</li>
			<li>Don't go after <strong>anything&nbsp;</strong> that goes over the edge. It does get prety windy which could cause hats, scarves or sunglasses to fly off the visitors persona.</li>
			  <li><strong>Do not run</strong> while going up or down the road.</li>
			<li>Do not get ahead of docent, and <strong>stay with the group</strong>.</li>
		  </ul>
<br>
		  <p>Once you are finish the safety talk, you can begin the tour.</p>
