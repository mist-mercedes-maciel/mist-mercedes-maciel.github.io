 	<h1>What to do Before the Tour</h1>
	<br>
	<div class="stepContent">
		<p>As a D1, you will iniciate communication with others in your tour (D2, VC docent and any Trainees that sign up for the tour) and arrange logistic to arrive at the park. For example, carpooling, meeting at the gate, meeting in Carmel, or drive as a caravan, etc. Also, make sure to communicate with the D1 from the tour before or after yours for any updates, news or other indications.</p>
		<p><strong>Arrive at the park one hour befor the scheduled tour time</strong>, so you don't have to rush *getting through the gates and prepare to start the tour.</p>
		<p>Once you arrive at the VC, gather the Docent Supplies:</p>
		<ul>
		<li><strong>Tour Backpack</strong> check for tour binder, entrance tally clip board and pen.</li>
		<li><strong>Take the State Park Radio</strong>; you don't have to turn it on, but you must keep it with you in case of an emergency.</li>
		<li><strong>Take walkie takie</strong>; this is yoyr main way to communicate with D2, VC, or a Trainee, so it must be turn on.</li>	
		<p>This is your oportunity to fine tune the plan for your tour with the team (D2, VC and T). For example, who will take on the first group of visitors, parking area logistics, etc.</p>
