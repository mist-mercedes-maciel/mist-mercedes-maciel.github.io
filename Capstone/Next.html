					<h3>Resources</h3>
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. Volunteers: Remember that volunteering to work a tour at the Lighthouse or at the NavFac is a team work activity, and there are a great variety of years of experience amond other volunteers. Therefore, your fellow volunteers are your first source of help.</h4>
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. Point Sur Website: After you sign in as a volunteer, under Training Documents, you will find several written resources that will help you streighten your knowledge regarding the operation of the Visitors Center and other topics. </h4>
					<a href="http://www.pointsur.org/">Point Sur State Historic Park</a>
					<br>
					<br>
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;3.Procedures Document: The following resource is an in depth handbook describing the operational procedure to the Square. </h4>

					<br>
			<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;4. Todd Bullman: If while you are at the VC,  you are experiencing issues or need troubleshooting assistance, you may contact our Square especialist, Todd.</h4>
		   <h4>   &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Todd Bullman 831-809-6811</h4>

		<br>
					<br>
			<h3>Trainee Sign Up</h3>	
			<h4>After completing the Tour Management II learning website, your next step in the Visitors Center taining is to contact Todd, he will let you know the available dates for an on-site training. Once you have determined which date works for you, you will log-in to the volunteer's page in the Point Sur website, and sign up as a trainee for the tour.</h4>
			<h4>Signing up as a Trainee will serve one of two purposes:</h4>
			<ul>
			<li><h4>It will provide an on-site/hands-on demonstration by one of our experienced VC docent. This will help you to put in practice all the processes and procedures you have learn.</h4></li>
			<li><h4>If you feel confident, this could be your opportunity to demonstrate the knowledge aquired and get the 'VC' section of the Docents check off list done.</h4></li>
