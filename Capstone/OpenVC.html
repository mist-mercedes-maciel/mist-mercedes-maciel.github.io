		<h1>Open the VC</h1>
	  <h3>Prepare the Visitors Center for a Tour</h3>
	<h5>Objective: In this section you will learn the series of task necessary for an effective Visitors Center experience.</h5>
	<br>
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;Before the day of the tour, you will receive communication from the D1 regarding plans for the team to arrive at the park. For example, some docents like or need to carpool to the park, some prefer to drive together as a caravan, and others prefer to meet at the park.</h4>
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;If you are meeting the rest of the tour team at the park, remember to arrive one hour before the scheduled start time of the tour, and follow the 'Gates Procedure' as explained in the <strong>Tour Management I</strong> training.</h4>
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;When you sign up to work the Visitors Center, you will be expected to complete a series of task that will prepare the VC for visitors. The task process is similar in both locations (Lighthouse VC and NavFac VC), but this section will focus on the task process at the Lighthouse VC because it is more extensive and complex here.</h4> 
		<h4>&nbsp; &nbsp;The following is a suggested ordely list of these tasks. Once you become more familiar with the operation of the VC, you will create your own routine to accomplish them. </h4>

In this cabinet, you will also find the cash box (more about the cash box in the next module). </p>
			<p><strong>Check operation of all docent radios.</strong> Ensure that radios are off and charged or changing while they are in the radio port. Take a charged walkie, turn it on and keep it with you at all times; this is your main form of communication with the rest of the team. The state radio always goes with the docent that will be letting visitors in at the Highway 1 gate.</p>
			<p><strong>Check VC telephone for dial tone.</strong> If the landline telephone does not have a dial tone, report the outage to the Chair or Vice Chair of volunteers asap. AT&T personal cellphones work at the rock.</p>
			<p>Finally, <strong>check the CAT Jump-Starter</strong> to ensure it is changed - recharge if necessary.</p>
